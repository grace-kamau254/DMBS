# Advantages of ACID Properties in DBMS
###### Data Consistency:
 ACID properties ensure that the data remains consistent and accurate after any transaction execution.
###### Data Integrity:
 ACID properties maintain the integrity of the data by ensuring that any changes to the database are permanent and cannot be lost.
###### Concurrency Control:
 ACID properties help to manage multiple transactions occurring concurrently by preventing interference between them.
###### Recovery:
 ACID properties ensure that in case of any failure or crash, the system can recover the data up to the point of failure or crash.
